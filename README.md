# CCI_PartIII_GQME

This repository corresponds to Part III of a series of tutorials about simulating 
quantum dynamics on quantum computers. 
Here, we focus on simulating the 
non-Markovian quantum open system dynamics described by a GQME. The quantum
algorithm, which is based on the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem, is demonstrated on the
spin-boson model.

## Setting Up the code

To run this code, copy all the repository contents into the Google Drive folder.
The CCIGQME_Tutorial.ipynb file is the code in the tutorial, 
with all the *.py files containing the necessary functions.

Then run the CCIGQME_Tutorial.ipynb file with GoogleColab. 
Please make sure to change and mount the Google Drive folder path (detail instructions in CCIGQME_Tutorial.ipynb).

## Data generated 
All the *.txt files contain the data resulting from executing CCIGQME_Tutorial.ipynb code, 
are given to you for your convenience.
